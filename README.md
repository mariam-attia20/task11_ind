project idea â‡’ is to write code that select objects from this photo and write the color and the shape on it
what the code does:
read the photo and make it gray , blue and canny
Extract contours from the image
Define the color for each shape with HSV Masks
Determine the geometric shape (circle, square, triangle...) using the number of corners and circumference.
Draw a rectangle around each shape and write its name + color on the resulting image.
